# HYPER
HYPER tool implement an innovative approach for optimal PAT selection in systems with hydraulic and/or electrical regulation, allowing to identify the optimal parameters of a PAT that maximize energy production making the selection of a PAT fast and effective.

The use of HYPER is referred to as: Marini, G., Maio, M., di Menna, F., Pugliese, F., de Paola, F., & Fontana, N. (2022). Innovative Approach for Selection of Pump as Turbine in Water Distribution Network. Environmental Sciences Proceedings, 21(1). https://doi.org/10.3390/environsciproc2022021025

In the directory are present different file: 
- An executable file namely HYPER.exe that need only a  matlab runtime (2022b) intalled 
- An installation file namely HYPER_AppInstaller where is inclused the download and installation of runtime from web.
- HYPER USER GUIDE is a brief and simple guide for the utilize of HYPER
- Two file of example input file of pattern that help the user to load a pattern in the correctly way.
